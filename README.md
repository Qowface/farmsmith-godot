# Farmsmith (Godot Version)

Godot 4.4 version of the 64x64 resolution farming adventure game I created in PICO-8 for [LOWREZJAM 2022](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2022). Make money selling crops. Help out the people/creatures you encounter. Grow the tools you need to proceed. Who needs a blacksmith anyway?
